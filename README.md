# cifar
CIFAR10 trained image classificatio model based on ResNet18

**main.py** starts the model training and also contains visualization of the first 5 images. The best model weights are saved for later use.
**net.py** contains the implementation of the network which is based on the popular Resnet18 architecture adapted to take CIFAR10 images

**Planned:** Playground for feeding images to the trained model, preferably web-based
